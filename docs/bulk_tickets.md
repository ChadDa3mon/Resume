# Problem
Whenever a new security threat came in (which happens almost daily) we would have to create a ticket for 40+ customers where our threat hunters then went in and looked for any of the IOCs from that threat. 

Creating 40+ tickets was a very time consuming task, highly prone to human error. 

# Solution
I designed an entirely new table in ServiceNow to help track these security alerts and added automation to automatically create tickets for all 40+ customers, filling in all of the relevant details. 

# Result
Substantial time savings and elimination of human error. This saved around a dozen hours of labor each week.
