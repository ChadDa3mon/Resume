This one shows how Automation is a key part of my day to day life. I also like it because it shows just how powerful browser automation tools like [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) can be. If you can automate your actions within a browser, you can automate just about anything you want. 

# Problem
While not really a problem, I have an ESPP with IBM where every paycheck I am able to buy shares of IBM at a discount. I can then turn around and sell these shares immediately, offering a small little 'bonus'. 

Unless I sell these shares on the same day, I risk losing money. 

# Solution
I developed an automation on my computer at home that uses [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) to log into my broker and sell any shares. This automation runs every day and logs the output so I can be made aware of errors. 

Shares are sold and the money automatically deposited into my account.
